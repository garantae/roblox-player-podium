# About
This script will check the players who have been marked in the top three places (from a different script) and apply them accordingly to the podium user interface after a match. 

# Functions
* #### Player Details
  * Shows both the player's username and avatar.
* #### Animation
  * The winners are revealed from lowest placement to highest placement (3rd to 1st) in a custom animation.
* #### Sound Effects
  * Plays sound effects in appropriate cues such as when the podium bars are being revealed or when a player is being rewarded.
* #### Automatic Close
  * After a set amount of time (in the configurables section), the podium will automatically close.
